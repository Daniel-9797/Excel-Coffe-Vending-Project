# Project Background

We came across a dataset of coffee sales from a machine, containing fewer than 1000 rows and 6 columns.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18191350-71b5-4218-893e-be9f7ed9ec0b)



# Cleaning Process
The first thing we noticed was the .CSV file. We opened Excel to use Power Query to convert the file. Once we did that, we began the cleaning process.

Since it's a small project, everything was converted correctly. However, we noticed a couple of issues:

- We have two date columns. The first one gives us day/month/year while the other adds the hour. In this case, we should clean the last column to keep the hour and date separate.

- On the other hand, we found that the amount spent had lost the comma. Additionally, it’s in Ukrainian Hryvnia. So, in this column, we need to return the decimal comma to its place and convert the currency back to Euros (even though the amount is going to be relatively cheaper than an actual Spanish coffee would be). However, for this purpose, we are going to keep the prices as they are. 

 
 We have some questions we want to answer through this analysis, such as:

- Which is the most frequently sold coffee?
- What’s the maximum amount spent and the average amount spent?
- Are there any frequent clients based on the anonymous ID numbers?
- Are people more likely to pay with cash or card?
- What are the peak hours?
- How much is made from each type of coffee?


    Once this was done, we created a table to search through filters for any rare values. Then, we started with pivot tables to answer the questions.


 
# Data Analysis

We found some interesting results and began creating graphs.

### Which is the most frequently sold coffee? How much is made for each type?

Type	            Profit	      Operations
Latte	            167,84 € 	    203
Americano w/ Milk	161,83 €     	227
Cappuccino	      146,19 € 	    177
Americano	        88,91 € 	    145
Hot Chocolate	    58,53 € 	    71
Cortado	          53,18 €     	86
Cocoa	            23,28 €      	28
Espresso	        20,31 € 	    39
Grand	            720,07 € 	    976
		

We found some interesting results and began creating graphs. But first, we already had some information to answer questions.

The most sold coffee is Americano with Milk, with a total of 227 out of 976 sales. However, it is not the highest revenue generator, as that title goes to the Latte.


 ### What’s the maximum amount spent and the average amount spent?
 
Sells	   MAX op	   MIN op	AVG op
720,07 €	0,88 €	0,51 €	0,74 €
			

We found that the total revenue generated by the machine was 720 euros, with a maximum transaction amount of 0.88 euros, a minimum of 0.51 euros, and an average of 0.74 euros per transaction.


### Are people more likely to pay with cash or card?

Type	money	     %	     OP
card	649,98 €	 90,27%	 887
cash	70,09 €	   9,73%	 89
Grand	720,07 €	100,00%	 976

9 out of 10 customer pay with a card.


### Are there any frequent clients based on the anonymous ID numbers?

 As we observed that 9 out of 10 customers pay with a card, we were able to track the cards to see if they were used more than once. We discovered that several customers did indeed make repeat purchases with the same card multiple times over the months, with the best customer making over 50 transactions.


### What are the peak hours?

 <img width="427" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce9413b9-dfdd-4d5b-b081-a9f3015ba6b1">



  We observed that transactions occurred between 7 AM and 10 PM. We identified a peak hour around 10 AM and some activity around 7 PM.

# Executive Summary
## Overview of Findings

We have seen that, specifically as a data analyst, we will need to master SQL, Excel, and a visualization program like Tableau or Power BI. Once these are mastered, we should focus on learning programming languages such as Python or R. Based on the analysis, it is indifferent which one is learned first. However, Python tends to be in higher demand.

Although Python appears before visualization programs in terms of importance, it is also more complex. From my perspective, it is better to leave it for later and first establish a solid foundation with the other skills.

Once you have learned the basics, you could work as a data or business analyst. As we have seen, the salaries for these roles are lower than those for data scientists, but they are still quite good.
